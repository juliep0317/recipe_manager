# Recipe Manager 
## The objective of this project is to create a Recipe Manager application using Python.

This project will consolidate the fundamental concepts learned throughout the course, including:
- data types
- control flow functions
- file handling
- basic data manipulation.

The Recipe Manager will allow users to add, view, search, edit, and delete recipes, demonstrating practical application of Python programming skills.

The recipe manager project was enjoyable, challenging but rewarding seeing the final product working successfully.
