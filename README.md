## The objective of this project is to create a Recipe Manager application using Python.

This project will consolidate the fundamental concepts learned throughout the course, including:
- data types
- control flow functions
- file handling
- basic data manipulation.

The Recipe Manager will allow users to add, view, search, edit, and delete recipes, demonstrating practical application of Python programming skills.

This project was enjoyable, challenging but rewarding seeing the final result.
